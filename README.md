# Smart_Gardening_Kit
This project was an IoT(Internet of Things)-based system for Smart Farming services to demonstrate how to collect, 
integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support for Farming and Gardening.


The idea of this project came so to reduce the headache of people as they fail to grow plants effectively.
